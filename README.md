This project in the Odin Project curriculum is about creating a simple and basic recipe website. I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directories and files, navigate and enter commands using the terminal. I also learned how to build an HTML layout for basic website building by entering text into different sections and headings. I am able to create ordered and unordered lists, style texts and input images and links. By the end of this project, I will able to organize and create a clean set of codes for my recipe website and add styles to it using CSS!
