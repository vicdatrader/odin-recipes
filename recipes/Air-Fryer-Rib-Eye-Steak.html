  <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>These air fryer rib-eye steaks definitely rival a steak cooked on a grill</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 rib-eye steaks, cut 1 1/2- inch thick</li>
      <li>4 teaspoons grill seasoning (any steak seasoning you have)</li>
      <li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
      <li>½ cup reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Combine steaks, soy sauce, olive oil, and seasoning in a large resealable bag. Marinate meat for at least 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Remove steaks from bag and discard the marinade. Pat excess oil off the steaks.</li>
      <li>Add about 1 tablespoon water to the bottom of the air fryer pan to prevent it from smoking during the cooking process.</li>
      <li>Preheat the air fryer to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Add steaks to air fryer and cook for 7 minutes. Turn steaks and cook for another 7 minutes until steak is medium rare. For a medium steak, increase the total cook time to 16 minutes, flipping steak after 8 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove steaks, keep warm, and let sit for about 4 minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
