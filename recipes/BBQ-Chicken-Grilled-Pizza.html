  <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>Quick and easy for those summer cookouts, the BBQ chicken is always a crowd pleaser! The dough never makes a perfect rectangle, but have fun guessing what it looks like. For the chicken, you can use the grilled chicken pre-cooked at the store.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup chopped cooked chicken</li>
      <li>Â½ cup BBQ sauce, divided</li>
      <li>1 (13.8 ounce) package refrigerated pizza dough</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or as needed</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Colby-Monterey Jack cheese</li>
      <li>1 cup diced tomatoes, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>Mix chicken and 2 tablespoons BBQ sauce together in a bowl until evenly coated.</li>
      <li>Roll dough onto a work surface and cut in half to form 2 rectangles. Brush the top of each rectangle with olive oil.</li>
      <li>Place dough, oil-side down, onto the grill; cook until bottom of dough is browned and top is bubbling up, about 5 minutes. Brush the tops of each dough with oil and flip.</li>
      <li>Spread the remaining BBQ sauce over each crust; top with chicken, Colby-Monterey Jack cheese, and tomatoes.</li>
      <li>Close the lid of the grill and cook pizza until cheese is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove pizza from grill and cool before slicing, 2 to 3 minutes. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
