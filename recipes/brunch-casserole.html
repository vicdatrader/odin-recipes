  <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
    <p>A hearty bacon, egg, and hash brown casserole for the bacon lover in all of us. Feel free to use turkey bacon rather than pork!</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 ½ pounds thick sliced bacon</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped sweet onion</li>
      <li>½ cup chopped red bell pepper</li>
      <li>12 eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
      <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon dried dill</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; reserving 2 tablespoons drippings in the skillet. Crumble bacon and set aside.</li>
      <li>Cook and stir onion and bell pepper over medium heat in reserved drippings until tender, about 5 minutes; remove with slotted spoon.</li>
      <li>Whisk eggs and milk in a large bowl. Fold hash browns, Cheddar cheese, salt, pepper, dill, onion mixture, and crumbled bacon into egg mixture; transfer to prepared baking dish.</li>
      <li>Bake in preheated oven until a knife inserted near the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes. Serve and Enjoy!</li>
