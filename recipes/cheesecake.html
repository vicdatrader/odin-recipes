    <h2>Recipe Description</h2>
      <p>New York Cheesecakes have three layers, starting with a Graham Cracker Crust. Next, is a deliciously rich, and tangy sweet, cream cheese filling that has a wonderfully dense and creamy smooth texture. The top layer is lightly sweetened sour cream. This cheesecake is very good on its own, or you can serve it with fresh berries or a fruit sauce.</p>
